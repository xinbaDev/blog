Recently, I have been playing a game called "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel," a JRPG that I hope can help me learn some Japanese. I ended up creating a game text extractor to make it easier for me to translate the in-game text. When combined with ChatGPT, it becomes a very helpful Japanese language teaching app. I can't help but record what I have learned during this process.

## Motivation

It all began with a YouTube channel I stumbled across called "Game Gengo," which focuses on learning Japanese through playing games. I have wanted to improve my Japanese for quite some time. After watching the channel, I realized that I enjoy playing RPG games, so I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to give it a try. I picked up a few JRPG games that interested me on Steam and gave it a shot. However, I soon found it quite difficult to enjoy the game if I had to constantly check the meaning of every word I encountered. I needed to make the learning process as easy as possible for myself. To achieve that goal, I needed to find a way to extract the text from the game instead of manually typing every single word into Google Translate. My initial thought was to create a program to extract the text from memory. But in order to do that, I needed to know the exact address of the text in memory. Knowing the address alone was not enough since it would change every time the game restarted. I needed to find a base address that could lead me to it.

## Journey

Although I had experience using cheat engine and had successfully created a program to modify money/stats in a similar game before, I had no experience in extracting text from any game whatsoever. The process turned out to be more challenging than I initially thought. I spent hours experimenting and playing with cheat engine just to find a base address that would allow me to locate the text address. During this process, I also learned to read some of the assembly code that I was not familiar with. Thanks to ChatGPT, the process became somewhat enjoyable as it explained the assembly code quite well when I presented it with the code. If it weren't for ChatGPT, this process would have been more tedious and frustrating. Eventually, I located the address of the text in memory, and I was quite happy about what I had achieved and learned during this process. ChatGPT really made it enjoyable for me.

After successfully extracting the text from the memory, I decided to take one step further. Why not let ChatGPT be my Japanese teacher and teach me the Japanese sentences in the game? I asked ChatGPT to imagine itself as my Japanese teacher and help me break down each Japanese sentence I sent, teaching me any grammar and vocabulary used. Once again, ChatGPT delivered as I expected. It was really helpful, as it made the learning process more enjoyable and saved me tons of time searching online by myself. With its help, I managed to learn a great deal of Japanese while still enjoying the game. This wouldn't have been possible before. I can't praise enough how good ChatGPT has been in helping me learn Japanese.

## How it helped me create the GUI

When creating the tools to extract the text, one of the challenges I faced was developing a visual interface, a GUI, to help me use it easily. Although I was aware of some libraries, such as Tkinter, that could assist me in creating it, I had no prior experience using them. Learning new tools and techniques is what a programmer should do in their daily life, but it would take time. Moreover, if I wanted to create an elegant interface, it would undoubtedly require a lot more time to tweak it. This is where ChatGPT came to the rescue. With its help, I could create an elegant interface that suited my needs in no time. Although it's not perfect, I was satisfied with what I had achieved with the help of ChatGPT in the relatively short time I had allocated.

## Final thoughts

ChatGPT is astonishingly powerful, and my feelings towards it are mixed. On one hand, I am excited about the potential ways it can help me. I have already experienced firsthand quite a few times, both in my work and in my life. I've grown to depend on it more and more. On the other hand, I feel threatened by its potential and fear that I might eventually lose my job because of it. I believe this feeling is not unique, and anyone who uses ChatGPT should realize that we are close to the era of AI, if not already in it.
