Lately, I've been engrossed in playing the captivating JRPG, "The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel." My primary motivation behind this gaming endeavor is to immerse myself in the world of Japanese language and culture. To enhance this language-learning experience, I embarked on the journey of creating a game text extractor, a tool that would simplify the translation of in-game text. When coupled with ChatGPT's capabilities, this innovative combination transformed into an incredibly valuable Japanese language teaching application. Allow me to share the insightful discoveries I've made throughout this process.

## The Initial Spark

My journey into the realm of learning Japanese through gaming was ignited by the discovery of the YouTube channel "Game Gengo," which focuses on harnessing the power of video games for language acquisition. Motivated by a longstanding desire to improve my Japanese language skills, I decided to give this unique approach a try. As an avid fan of RPG games, I purchased a selection of JRPG titles on Steam and dived headfirst into the adventure. However, I soon realized that the constant need to look up the meanings of unfamiliar words hindered my enjoyment of the games. To make my language-learning experience seamless, I needed to find a way to effortlessly extract text from the games instead of manually translating each word. Thus, the idea of creating a program to extract in-game text from memory was born. But this endeavor came with its own set of challenges, including identifying the ever-changing memory addresses for the text.

## The Path Less Traveled

While I had prior experience using cheat engine for game modifications, text extraction was an entirely new frontier for me. It quickly became evident that this undertaking was more complex than I initially anticipated. Countless hours were spent experimenting with cheat engine, searching for a stable base address that could lead me to the elusive text addresses. Throughout this process, I also acquired a rudimentary understanding of assembly code, thanks in large part to ChatGPT's insightful explanations when I presented it with code snippets. Without ChatGPT's assistance, this process would have undoubtedly been more arduous and frustrating. Eventually, after persistent efforts, I successfully located the memory address containing the in-game text. This achievement marked a significant milestone in my language-learning journey, and ChatGPT played a pivotal role in making it an enjoyable and insightful experience.

## Elevating Learning with ChatGPT

Having conquered the task of text extraction, I decided to take my language-learning journey one step further. Why not enlist ChatGPT as my Japanese teacher and use it to deconstruct and explain the Japanese sentences within the game? I envisioned ChatGPT as my virtual sensei, helping me dissect grammar and vocabulary within each sentence. Once again, ChatGPT exceeded my expectations. It transformed the learning process, making it not only enjoyable but also efficient by saving me countless hours of independent online research. With ChatGPT's guidance, I acquired a substantial amount of Japanese knowledge while still savoring the gaming experience. Such a synergy between gaming and learning would have been inconceivable before, and I can't express enough how invaluable ChatGPT has been in my Japanese language journey.

## Make it speak

One limitation of the game I was playing was the absence of voice acting in most instances. This posed a challenge to my goal of improving my Japanese listening skills. After some dedicated searching, I stumbled upon an open-source project named [ChatWaifu](https://github.com/cjyaddone/ChatWaifu/tree/main), powered by ChatGPT and Moegoe TTS, which provided a solution to this issue. I quickly implemented my own version and was delighted with the results. With just a click of a button, I could now hear an AI-generated voice, resembling that of a native speaker, whenever there was no voice acting in the game. This breakthrough significantly enhanced my listening practice.

## Empowering GUI Creation

While developing the text extraction tools, I encountered the challenge of designing a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) to streamline the process. Although I was aware of libraries like Tkinter that could assist in GUI creation, I had no prior experience with them. Learning new tools and techniques is an inherent part of a programmer's journey, but it can be time-consuming, especially when starting from scratch. Furthermore, crafting an elegant and intuitive interface would undoubtedly require even more time and effort. This is where ChatGPT came to my rescue once again. With its guidance, I rapidly designed an elegant GUI tailored to my needs. While not perfect, I was remarkably satisfied with what I achieved in a relatively short period, thanks to ChatGPT's support.

## Closing Thoughts

ChatGPT is undeniably a powerful tool, and my sentiments toward it are a blend of excitement and apprehension. On one hand, I am thrilled by the numerous ways it enhances my abilities and aids me in various aspects of life and work. I've come to rely on it increasingly. In fact, ChatGPT played a significant role in helping me write this very article. On the other hand, I am wary of its potential to replace human roles in the workforce, including mine. This concern is not unique to me; it's a sentiment that anyone who engages with ChatGPT should acknowledge. We are undoubtedly on the cusp, if not already immersed, in the era of AI, and it's imperative that we adapt to this evolving landscape.
